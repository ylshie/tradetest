                </div>
                <div className={commstyles.TOUDetail}>
                NFT(NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN）is a Web3.0 application. Compared to Fungible Token, every NFT performs differently, and they cannot be replaced or separated from each other. Like any form of pictures, music, videos, even the 3D model works and any type of file structure, because of the technical support of blockchain, it will be difficult to distort and copy easily after the link has been established.

                Make sure your purchases originate from a real Trade3.0 address.
                <br/>
                Do not reply to unsolicited direct messages
                <br/>
                Do not engage in trust-based transactions
                <br/>
                Use common sense. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.

                How to judge the authenticity of the collection
                <br/>
                If you are not sure about the authenticity of the collection, we recommend that you check the contract address.
                <br/>
                All Trade3.0 projects are connected to one of the following smart contract addresses:
                <br/>
                ETHEREUM BlockChain Address
                <br/>
                SOLANA BlockChain Address
                <br/>
                POLYGON BlockChain Address
                <br/>
                Do not engage with unsolicited DMs
                <br/>
                If you have contacted strangers in Discord (or social media) direct messages. Most of the time the message may be a scam message and the official will not contact you directly
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To avoid these types of attacks, we recommend two options:
                <br/>
                Turn off direct messages from strangers.
                <br/>
                Do not click links from untrusted sources. If someone is sharing something with you, we highly recommend using a little Google to find it yourself. Bad actors can create persuasive phishing websites.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Trust-Based Trades
                <br/>
                The crypto ecosystem is designed to remove trust from the transaction process. The blockchain’s rules are structured so intermediaries are largely taken out of the equation, and people have ultimate control over their assets. However, private trade agreements inject trust back into the process in a way that also increases the likelihood of being scammed.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How to trade
                <br/>
                To avoid being the victim during a trade, we recommend NEVER sending a piece and expecting to get something in return. Instead, use a swapping website. Use Common Sense
                <br/>
                The best line of defense against online scams is to use common sense and assume anyone reaching out privately has ulterior motives. Of course, con artists will evolve their tactics, but approaching every online interaction with skepticism will reduce your exposure to being compromised. And remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
